The fourth Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW) aims to provide an international forum for doctoral students in computing. While most conferences and workshops in academia solely cater for specific research areas, ICCSW encourages doctoral students from all disciplines in computer science to submit, review papers and take part in the event. It is a workshop organised by students for students. The workshop will be hosted by the Department of Computing at Imperial College London.

The workshop offers:

* A traditional track featuring
	* Technical papers focused on current topics in computer science
	* Tool papers describing the design, functionality and applicability of a software tool
* A survey track featuring papers that synthesise the state of the art in a particular topic of computer science

Areas of interest for the workshop cover all fields of research in computer science, including (but not limited to) the following:

* Computer Systems
* Databases
* Logic and Artificial Intelligence
* Networks and Communictaions
* Programming Languages
* Software Engineering
* Theory of Computational Systems
* Verification and Model Checking
* Machine Learning
* Computer Graphics

### Important Dates

* Abstracts due: **Friday, July 11, 2014, 23:59:59 BST**
* Paper submission due: **Friday, July 18, 2014, 23:59:59 BST**
* Reviews due: **Friday, July 25, 2014, 23:59:59 BST**
* Acceptance notification: **Wednesday, July 30, 2014**
* Final papers due: **Friday, August 15, 2014**

### Submission

Page limits:

* 7 pages for technical and survey papers, excluding references
* 5 pages for tool papers, excluding references


The main criterion for evaluating the submissions will be originality. Papers based on previous published work will be considered only if they include a description of changes from the published paper. Submission of papers should be done via EasyChair at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw14.

For each submitted paper, the authors will be required to review approximately two or three papers, not necessarily related to the topic of their immediate expertise. To ensure reviews are objective and meet academic standards the steering committee will look at all reviews prior to their release.
 
All accepted technical, survey and tools papers of ICCSWâ€™14 will be published in the OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs) by Schloss Dagstuhl ([OASIcs format](http://iccsw.doc.ic.ac.uk/2014/iccsw14-authors.tgz)
). It is expected that one of the paper authors will attend the conference and present their work. Electronic copies of the proceedings will be made available for all participants at the time of the workshop.

### Registration and Travel Bursaries

Registration is free of charge for all students. Some student bursaries, funded by industrial sponsors, will be made available to students with submissions accepted in the workshop. We aim to provide financial support for students who otherwise would be unable to attend. To contact workshop organisers with any questions, please email: iccsw@imperial.ac.uk


### Organisation

The local steering committee consists of research students from the department, who will be responsible for the organisation of the workshop. Research students from outside Imperial College are invited to join the organisation as ambassadors of the workshop to promote it at their respective university and coordinate students wishing to participate in the workshop.

ICCSW is organised by the [Imperial College London ACM Student Chapter](http://acm.doc.ic.ac.uk). The current list of steering committee members can be found in the
[Organisation](/2014/organisation.html) page.
