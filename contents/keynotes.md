### Shane Legg, Google DeepMind

Summary: TBD

_Biography: Shane Legg, PhD, Chief Scientist at Google DeepMind.  Shane obtained his PhD from IDSIA in Switzerland, supervised by Prof. Marcus Hutter, the leading authority on theoretical models of super intelligent machines.  His thesis proposed a formal definition of machine intelligence, for which he was awarded the $10,000 Canadian Singularity Institute research prize.  He spent a post doctoral year at the Swiss Finance Institute building models of human decision making, followed by two years at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL studying the algorithmic organisation of the brain.  In 2011 he cofounded DeepMind Technologies with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman.  After three years of rapid growth and a number of research breakthroughs, DeepMind was acquired by Google._
