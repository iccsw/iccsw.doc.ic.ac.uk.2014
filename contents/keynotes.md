## TBD
### Shane Legg, Google DeepMind

Summary: TBD

_Biography: Shane Legg is a world-leading expert on universal sequence prediction, reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Over the last decade he was a senior engineer in two of the most significant commercial AI efforts in the world, Webmind and Adaptive Intelligence. These experiences have significantly shaped his thinking on how to perform effective AGI research and development. He then obtained his PhD from the renowned IDSIA lab in Switzerland, supervised by Prof. Marcus Hutter, the leading authority on theoretical models of super intelligent machines. His thesis proposed a formal definition of machine intelligence, work that has become the basis of rigorous measures of AGI progress. For this landmark research he won the Canadian Singularity Institute research prize. He then spent a post doctoral year at the Swiss Finance Institute building models of human decision making, followed by two years at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit investigating the algorithmic organisation and principles of the brain._
