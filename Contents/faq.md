the article.

Please use OASIcs LaTeX style. You can find a copy

__What are the instructions for papers that has either been previously
published elsewhere?__

There are a number of accepted submissions that are not truly "original
work" (e.g., they have been previously presented in a longer format at a
previous conference/workshop or accepted in a journal). If you paper is
one of these submissions, we ask that you kindly revise your manuscript
in the following way: please use ``\footnote{...}`` to add a
footnote to your title. Please include text similar to the following:

*A longer version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of
ConferenceInitials [XX].*

where "ConferenceInitials" are the initials of the conference (e.g.,
"ICCSW" for "Imperial College Computing Student Workshop") and "[XX]" is
a citation to the full, original paper included in your bibliography.

For example, in LaTeX, your sources may now include something similar
to:

```
\title{My really awesome paper\footnote{A longer version of this paper
appeared in the proceedings of ABC~\cite{MyPaper}.}}
```
