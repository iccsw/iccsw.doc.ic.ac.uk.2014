The fourth Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW) aims to provide an international forum for doctoral students in computing. While most conferences and workshops in academia solely cater for specific research areas, ICCSW encourages doctoral students from all disciplines in computer science to submit, review papers and take part in the event. It is a workshop organised by students for students. The workshop will be hosted by the Department of Computing at Imperial College London.

The workshop offers:

* A traditional track featuring
	* Technical papers focused on current topics in computer science
	* Tool papers describing the design, functionality and applicability of a software tool
* A survey track featuring papers that synthesise the state of the art in a particular topic of computer science

Areas of interest for the workshop cover all fields of research in computer science, including (but not limited to) the following:

* Computer Systems
* Databases
* Logic and Artificial Intelligence
* Networks and Communictaions
* Programming Languages
* Software Engineering
* Theory of Computational Systems
* Verification and Model Checking
* Machine Learning
* Computer Graphics

### Important Dates

* Abstracts due: **Friday, June 27, 2014, 23:59:59 BST**
* Paper submission due: **Friday, July 4, 2014, 23:59:59 BST**
* Reviews due: **Friday, July 25, 2014, 23:59:59 BST**
* Acceptance notification: **Wednesday, July 30, 2014**
* Final papers due: **Friday, August 15, 2014**

### Submission

Page limits:

* 7 pages for technical and survey papers, excluding references, [OASIcs format](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cn06/f/iccsw14-authors.tgz)
* 5 pages for tool papers, excluding references, [OASIcs format](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cn06/f/iccsw14-authors.tgz)

More details about the submission process will be announced later.
The main criterion for evaluating the submissions will be originality. Papers based on previous published work will be considered only if they include a description of changes from the published paper.

All accepted technical, survey and tools papers of ICCSW’14 will be published in the OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs) by Schloss Dagstuhl. It is expected that one of the paper authors will attend the conference and present their work. Electronic copies of the proceedings will be made available for all participants at the time of the workshop.
